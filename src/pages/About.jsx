        <p>Greetings!</p>
        <p> I'm Anna Britta Pincus, a 28-year-old who resides in Norfolk, VA. I hold a B.S. in Biology from Virginia Tech and a M.S. in Exercise Science from Old Dominion University. Although my home is in Norfolk, I spend most of my free time travelling to different parts of the country exploring natural wonders and climbing. I find great happiness in physical activity and helping others succeed in their goals, which has led me to pursue past careers within the health and fitness field. While I still fondly partake in that field, my main focus has redirected towards front stack developement and it's career possibilities.</p>

        <p>Beyond my professional commitments, as I hinted above I am an ardent advocate of an active lifestyle. I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, running, weight training, ultimate frisbee, and more. On most evenings you can find me either at the gym or outside pebble wrestling. Physical activity brings me great joy and helps me maintain a strong sense of self, along with a healthy body and mind. On slower days I prefer to read or paint with my main muse being nature and the beautiful landscapes that surround us.</p>

        <p>By embracing an active and balanced lifestyle, I strive to create a life for myself that is full of unique and memorable experiences. It is my hope to find joy in all that I do, both in work and my extracurricular activities.</p>
